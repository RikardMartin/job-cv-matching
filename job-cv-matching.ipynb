    "1. Get CV documents from CV database\n",
    "2. Summarize the CV documents to make them shorter and more information dense\n",
    "3. Transform the CV documents to numerical embeddings in order to compare them with job postings in an easy way\n",
    "4. Read a job posting and transform it in the same way as with the CV documents\n",
